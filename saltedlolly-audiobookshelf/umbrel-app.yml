  Audiobookshelf NAS Edition adds support for accessing network shares from within Audiobookshelf, allowing you to access your media on NAS/SMB/NFS shares.


  🚧 🚨 WARNING: This app is currently under development and may not be fully functional. Data loss is possible. Use for testing only.


  ⚠️ IMPORTANT - READ THIS BEFORE INSTALLING!! 👇
  
  If you are currently using the Audiobookshelf app from the Umbrel App Store, please read this carefully:

  - When switching from the Audiobookshelf app in the Umbrel App Store to this NAS Edition, library data is NOT preserved.
  
  - Make sure you BACK UP your existing Audiobookshelf library before proceeding, or you will need to recreate your library from scratch.

  - You must uninstall the existing Audiobookshelf app before installing this edition, but doing so, will delete your existing library data. This includes all user accounts, libraries and metadata. (Your media files will be preserved.)
  
  - You can use the ABS Library Migration Tool to help you migrate your existing library from the official app. See the instructions here: https://github.com/saltedlolly/umbrel-app-store/tree/master/saltedlolly-audiobookshelf/tools#readme


  Audioookshelf - NAS Edition Features:

  
  - Audiobookshelf can access your media stored on a network share elsewhere on your local network (e.g. NAS, SMB, NFS, etc.)

  - Mount any network share in the Umbrel Files app and it is immediately accessible to Audiobookshelf

   - Specify which shares are required by Audiobookshelf using the provided Network Share Config Tool

  - After a system restart, Audiobookshelf will wait for the required network shares to become available before starting up, preventing errors due to missing media.

  - Local folders for Audiobooks and Podcasts are accessible in the Files app

  - Your user accounts, libraries & metadata, along with any Audiobooks and Podcasts stored on your Umbrel, are all backed up by Umbrel's backup system


  Direct Access URLs:

  - Network Shares Config Tool: http://umbrel.local:23378 (opens from dashboard icon)

  - Main Audiobookshelf App: http://umbrel.local:13378 (opens from config tool)

  
  ⚠️ After mounting a new network share, you must RESTART the Audiobookshelf app to access it (right-click app icon → Restart)
