description: >-
 Expose your apps to the internet easily and securely. This is an improved fork of Nginx Proxy Manager.


  ⚠️ Be cautious when exposing apps to the public internet. Ensure they have proper security, such as login protection, and avoid exposing sensitive apps without adequate safeguards.
  

  🔧 NPMplus uses port 50080 for HTTP (unsecured) traffic and port 50443 for HTTPS (secured) traffic.
  To make your apps accessible from the public internet, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router.
  Forward external port 80 (HTTP) to internal port 50080 and external port 443 (HTTPS) to internal port 50443 (tcp and udp).

  🔍 Features:
  
    - Beautiful and Secure Admin Interface based on Tabler
    - Easily create forwarding domains, redirections, streams and 404 hosts without knowing anything about Nginx
    - Free SSL using Let's Encrypt or provide your own custom SSL certificates
    - Access Lists and basic HTTP Authentication for your hosts
    - Advanced Nginx configuration available for super users
    - User management, permissions and audit log  
    - NPMplus Enhancements:
      - CrowdSec integration for enhanced security against threats
      - Additional security headers for improved protection
      - Customizable rate limiting to prevent abuse
      - Enhanced logging and monitoring features
      - Regular updates and community-driven improvements

  ### Upgrading from NPM to NPMplus

  💥 The NPMplus ports are chosen to avoid conflicts with the NPM app available in the Umbrel app store, which uses ports 40080 (http) and 40443 (https).
  This makes it possible to run both side by side, while switching over. However, NPM proxy host configurations are not shared with NPMplus - these will need to be copied over manually.
  When you are ready to switch, simply update port forwarding on your router to point to the NPMplus ports.

  While proxy host configurations are not shared between NPM and NPMplus, the Let's Encrypt SSL certificates are stored in a shared volume.
  This means that any domains you have already secured with SSL in NPM will continue to work seamlessly in NPMplus without needing to re-issue certificates.
