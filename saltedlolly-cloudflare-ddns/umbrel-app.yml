  Dynamic DDNS client for Cloudflare to keep your domain or sub-domain updated with your current public IP address.

  Features:

  - Runs the favonia/cloudflare-ddns client in a Docker container.

  - Includes a simple web UI for managing and monitoring the status of the DDNS client, secured by Umbrel SSO.

  - Makes it easy to enter your Cloudflare API token and the domains or subdomains you wish to keep updated.

  - Lets you view live logs and the last IP update directly from the web UI.

  - Enable/disable the DDNS client from the UI.
